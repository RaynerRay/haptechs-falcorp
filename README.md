# Project structure and design choices.
My project is of a fictional company called Haptechs, that gives users info about SpaceX launches and rockets.
### Tech Stack:
React, Typescript, Tanstack React-Query, Material UI, Tailwind Css, and Lucide-react icons
I decided to add additional packages like tanstack-react-query to handle the complexities of fetching and caching the data.
